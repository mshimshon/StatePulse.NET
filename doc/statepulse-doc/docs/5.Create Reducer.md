## ðŸ”„ Reducers â€“ Pure State Updates

A **reducer** is a pure function that updates a specific part of the state in response to an action.

### âœ¨ Key Principles

Reducers:

- Take the **current state** and an **action**
- Return a **new state**
- Must be **pure** â€” no side effects, service calls, or randomness
- Are called **after effects**, if any exist


### ðŸš« Async Tips

Reducers may return `Task<TState>`, but should **avoid unnecessary `await`**. 

```csharp title="IncrementReducer.cs"
internal class IncrementReducer : IReducer<CounterState, IncrementCounterResultAction>
{
    public Task<CounterState> ReduceAsync(CounterState state, IncrementCounterResultAction action)
    => Task.FromResult(state with
    {
        Count = action.Count
    });
}
```
