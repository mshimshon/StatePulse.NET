## üöÄ Dispatcher ‚Äì Executing Actions in StatePulse

The **dispatcher** in StatePulse is responsible for preparing and executing actions in a clean and fluent way.  
Unlike some traditional systems, the dispatch pattern here is more structured:

### üß≠ Dispatch Flow

The standard flow for dispatching an action is:

1. `Prepare<TAction>()` ‚Äì creates the action instance
2. `.With(...)` ‚Äì sets properties on the action
3. `.DispatchAsync()` ‚Äì executes the action

This approach promotes immutability, clear intent, and safe updates.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è About Constructors

You **can** pass constructor arguments in `Prepare<T>()`, like this:

```csharp
Dispatcher.Prepare<MyAction>(arg1, arg2);
```

But this is **strongly discouraged**, and ideally avoided completely.

‚ùó **Why avoid it?**  
If the constructor changes later (e.g., parameter added, removed, or reordered),  
**the compiler won‚Äôt warn you**, and your dispatch logic may **break silently at runtime**.

This can lead to:
- Incorrect action initialization
- Subtle bugs
- Hard-to-trace state issues

### Inject into Component

```csharp title="Counter.razor.cs"
public partial class Counter : ComponentBase
{
    [Inject] private IDispatcher Dispatcher { get; set; }
    private async Task Increment()
    {
        await Dispatcher.Prepare<IncrementCounterAction>()
             .With(p => p.Delay, 1)
             .DispatchAsync();
    }
}
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Pre-initializing Actions (Optional)

You can also **pre-initialize an action** manually ‚Äî similar to how it's done in conventional state management systems.

This approach is useful when:

- You're using **constructor-based action records**
- You're **dispatching actions in a loop**, where minimizing per-dispatch overhead matters
  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **While the reflection overhead of `Prepare<T>()` is small, it does exist.** In performance-critical scenarios (like loops or tight UI updates), **pre-initializing the action** can offer a slight efficiency gain.

```csharp title="Counter.razor.cs"
public partial class Counter : ComponentBase
{
    [Inject] private IDispatcher Dispatcher { get; set; }
    private async Task Increment()
    {
        await Dispatcher.Prepare(()=> new IncrementCounterAction(){
            Delay = 1
        }).DispatchAsync();
    }
}
```

### üßµ Safe Execution On-the-Fly

Every action in StatePulse can be executed **on-the-fly as a safe action**,  
meaning any **subsequent execution cancels the previous one**.  
This significantly reduces the risk of race conditions in async workflows.

> ‚úÖ This is especially helpful for API calls, debounced interactions, or long-running processes.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Use Safe Actions Selectively

While powerful, **safe actions come with a small overhead footprint**.  
You should **avoid using them** for:
- Reducer-only actions (e.g., local counter updates)
- Instantaneous operations where no async delay exists

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Overusing `ISafeAction` can lead to performance degradation in large or complex UIs.**  
> While it's unlikely you'll encounter direct issues in most apps,  
> **why not save performance when it's that easy to do?**

Use `ISafeAction` only when the benefits ‚Äî like cancellation, deduplication, or race condition protection ‚Äî are necessary.

### ‚è≥ Await Pipeline

You can **await the dispatch pipeline**, which means your code will **block execution until the entire pipeline completes**:

- All **effects** (including cascading effects) finish
- All **reducers** have executed
- The full state update cycle is done

This feature is **not common in traditional Redux-style state management**,  
which often relies on external tools (like Redux DevTools) to observe state changes asynchronously.

#### Why Awaiting Matters in .NET / StatePulse

- The .NET environment encourages **step-by-step debugging**, which is often the most effective way to diagnose issues.
- `.Await()` enables this by making the dispatch synchronous from the caller‚Äôs perspective.
- This is why it‚Äôs **important to always await dispatches** ‚Äî it ensures predictable, debuggable code flow.

```csharp title="Counter.razor.cs"
public partial class Counter : ComponentBase
{
    [Inject] private IDispatcher Dispatcher { get; set; }
    private async Task Increment()
    {
        await Dispatcher.Prepare<IncrementCounterAction>()
             .With(p => p.Delay, 1)
             .Await() // <- Block Execution until all tasks are done.
             .DispatchAsync();
    }
}
```
