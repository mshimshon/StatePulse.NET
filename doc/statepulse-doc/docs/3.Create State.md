## Defining a State

A **state** represents a slice of your application's data. It should be:

- Immutable (defined as a `record`)
- Serializable (for debugging, testing, or persistence)
- Focused (represents a single domain or feature)

### Example: Counter State
```csharp title="CounterState.cs"
public record CounterState : IStateFeature
{
    public int Count { get; init; }
}
```


## 🎯 Manual State Hooking

The **manual subscription approach** is the most **performant and reliable** way to handle state updates — in StatePulse or any other state management library.

By **explicitly subscribing and unsubscribing** to a specific state, only the components that depend on that state are re-rendered.  
This avoids unnecessary rendering and offers precise control.

### ✅ Why This Is Optimal

- **No overhead** from global tracking or base components
- **Fine-grained control** over component updates
- **Best performance**, especially in large apps
- **Works without any framework-specific magic**

> ⚠️ The downside? It requires more boilerplate.  
> That's why many libraries introduce alternatives like global components, wrappers, or base components — but these come with trade-offs in flexibility or overhead.

### 🛠️ Example: Manual State Hook

```csharp title="Counter.razor.cs"
public partial class Counter : ComponentBase, IAsyncDisposable
{
    [Inject] IStateAccessor<CounterState> State { get; set; }
    [Inject] private IDispatcher Dispatcher { get; set; }

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        State.OnStateChangedNoDetails += ShouldUpdate;
    }

    private void ShouldUpdate(object? sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        _ = InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged);
    }

    private async Task Increment()
    {
        await Dispatcher.Prepare<IncrementCounterAction>()
             .With(p => p.Delay, 1)
             .DispatchAsync();
    }

    public ValueTask DisposeAsync()
    {
        State.OnStateChangedNoDetails -= ShouldUpdate;
        return ValueTask.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

## 🌀 Zero-Boilerplate Without Compromise

StatePulse **does not force you** to inherit from a base component or use a global component to track state changes.  
Instead, StatePulse provides a **clever and efficient mechanism** to track components that request state,  
binding them automatically with:

- ✅ **Memory leak protection**
- ⚡ **Optimized getters**
- 🧼 **Zero boilerplate on your side**

This ensures **no architectural compromises** burden placed on you.


StatePulse offers a **zero-boilerplate** way to subscribe to and track component-bound state changes — using ```IStatePulse```.

This method requires **no manual subscription or disposal**, yet still tracks updates **per component**, safely and efficiently.


### 🛠️ Example: Zero-Boilerplate State Hook

```csharp title="Counter.razor.cs"
public partial class Counter : ComponentBase
{
    [Inject] IStatePulse Pulse { get; set; }
    private CounterState State => Pulse.StateOf<CounterState>(() => this, ShouldUpdate);
    [Inject] private IDispatcher Dispatcher { get; set; }
    public Task ShouldUpdate() => InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged);
    private async Task Increment()
    {
        await Dispatcher.Prepare<IncrementCounterAction>()
             .With(p => p.Delay, 1)
             .DispatchAsync();
    }
}
```
> 📝 **Note on `StateOf()` Usage**

You might notice that `Pulse.StateOf<CounterState>(() => this, ShouldUpdate)` is called during every render.  
At first glance, this may seem inefficient — but it’s actually intentional and necessary.

This method guarantees that the component is correctly bound to the state and always get latest state.  
Without using this shorthand, you’d be forced to call `StateOf(...).Property` directly in your Razor markup, which becomes less readable and harder to maintain.

When `StateOf()` is called:
- StatePulse checks whether the component (identified by `()=> this`) is already being tracked.
- If not, it sets up the binding and associates the provided `ShouldUpdate` method as a re-render callback.
- If it is already tracked, the call becomes a fast property access with near-zero overhead.

⚡ **The only cost is during the initial setup.**  
All future calls are optimized and safe to run on every render.

This design ensures you always have **up-to-date, reactive state** with **no boilerplate** and **minimal performance impact**.
