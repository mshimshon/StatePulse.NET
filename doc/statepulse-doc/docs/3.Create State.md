## Defining a State

A **state** represents a slice of your application's data. It should be:

- Immutable (defined as a `record`)
- Serializable (for debugging, testing, or persistence)
- Focused (represents a single domain or feature)

### Example: Counter State
```csharp title="CounterState.cs"
public record CounterState : IStateFeature
{
    public int Count { get; init; }
}
```
