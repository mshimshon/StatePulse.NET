## ðŸ“¦ Installation & Setup

```bash
Install-Package StatePulse.Net

dotnet add package StatePulse.Net

```

Add to ```Program.cs```: 
```cs
builder.Services.AddStatePulseServices(o => {});
```

Create StatePulse common folder structure.
```
/Pulses/
/Pulses/Counter <- Feature
/Pulses/Counter/Actions
/Pulses/Counter/Effects
/Pulses/Counter/Effects/Validators
/Pulses/Counter/Reducers
/Pulses/Counter/Stores
```

This structure is complete and very common pattern.

## Add Services

There are 2 ways to add services for StatePulse.

### Scan Assmblies
The easiest way is to scan whatever assembly you have pulses in.

```cs title="program.cs"
builder.Services.AddStatePulseServices(o =>
{
    o.ScanAssemblies = new Type[] { typeof(Program) };
});
```

### Manual Registering
StatePulse provide extension methods to add type of services and you **MUST** use them otherwise you face issues.

```cs title="program.cs"
builder.Services.AddStatePulseAction<IAction>();
builder.Services.AddStatePulseEffect<IEffect>();
builder.Services.AddStatePulseEffectValidator<IEffectValidator>();
builder.Services.AddStatePulseReducer<IReducer>();
builder.Services.AddStatePulseStateFeature<IStateFeature>();
```
*Note: you must manually register all services during unit test... the assembly scan doesn't get along well with unit testing.*
