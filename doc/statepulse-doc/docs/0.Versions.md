## 📦 v1.0.0

### ✨ Minor Change
- Splited Abstractions into StatePulse.Net.Abstractions (Will not break anything Namespace is the same)

## 📦 v1.0.0

### ✨ New Features

- ✅ **Action Effect Validator**: Allows effects to run conditionally by validating them before execution.
- 🧩 **Middleware Support**:
  - `IEffectMiddleware`
  - `IReducerMiddleware`
  - `IDispatchMiddleware`
- ⚙️ **Behavior Configuration**: You can configure execution behaviors via:
  - `DispatchEffectBehavior`
  - `MiddlewareEffectBehavior`
  - `MiddlewareTaskBehavior`
- 🛠️ **Strict Manual Registration**: Manual service registration **must use** extension methods:
  - `AddStatePulse()`
  - `AddStatePulseEffect<>()`
  - `AddStatePulseAction<>()`
  - `AddStatePulseReducer<>()`
  - `AddStatePulseStateFeature<>()`
  - `AddStatePulseEffectValidator<>()`

### 💥 Breaking Changes

- ❌ Removed **Action Validator** – validating action data is not the responsibility of the state management layer.
- 🔄 Renamed:
  - `IStateAccessor<>.StateChanged` → `OnStateChanged`
  - `UsingSynchronousMode` → **Removed**
  - `Sync()` → `Await()` for clarity and accuracy

### 🚀 Performance Improvements

- 🧠 Improved **dispatcher caching**
- ⚡ Enhanced **type cache** in `StatePulseRegistry`
- 🧬 Replaced reflection with **dynamic method caching** for faster dispatching

### 🧼 Clean Code Improvements

- 🧹 Refactored `DispatchPrepper` for cleaner and lighter internal logic

### 🐞 Fixes

- 🛠️ Resolved several **null reference warnings**
- 🧽 Removed leftover **internal artifacts**

## v0.9.41
- Fix: Added Anti-Service duplication to avoid double triggers.

## v0.9.4
- Breaking Change, StateOf no longer accept lambda will throw exception you must define a Task directly... this was necessary due to Garbage Collector and tracking behavior.
- Deprecated UsingSynchronousMode() instead use Sync().

## v0.9.21
- Implement the Blazor Package and removed dependencies to Blazor ComponentBase which is no longer required... 
- Any objects within .NET can now use IStatePulse and benefit from state management without extra implementations.
- Renamed IPulse to IStatePulse
- ```using IStatePulse.StateOf(()=>this, () => InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged));```


## v0.9.2 (Blazor Packages)
- Deprecated now part of StatePulse regular since we have removed the dependencies to blazor component.
... that was quick!
